# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  lack of error handling when processing incoming POST requests. The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code.  The server accepts user data but fails to validate it, leading to potential issues and unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug Description

The server doesn't check if the request body contains all the necessary fields or if the data types are correct.  This can result in unexpected errors or crashes if the client sends incomplete or malformed data.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file implements input validation and error handling to prevent unexpected issues.  It checks for the presence of required fields and appropriate data types before processing user data.  It also provides meaningful error responses to the client in case of validation errors.
